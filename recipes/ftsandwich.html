            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            A sandwich with all the comfort. You can cook the bacon in a skillet instead of the oven, if desired. I also
            sprinkled the sandwich with cinnamon.

            Ingredients
        </h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>8 slices maple-cured bacon</li>
            <li>7 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>4 slices bread</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

            Instructions
        </h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay bacon strips
                in a single layer on prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper
                towels.</li>
            <li>Beat 3 eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large, shallow bowl. Dip each slice of
                bread into egg mixture to saturate completely.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook bread slices in hot oil,
                turning once, until browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Transfer toast to a plate.</li>
            <li>Beat remaining eggs in a bowl. Cook and stir eggs in the same skillet over medium heat until eggs are
                scrambled and set, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place 1 slice of toast on a plate and top with 1/2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the scrambled eggs, and 1 slice
                of toast. Repeat with remaining toast, bacon, and eggs. Top each sandwich with maple syrup.</li>
